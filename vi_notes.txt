##In contras you to the beginning of the file; G to the end to regular text editor, you use keys h, j, k, and l instead of 
## arrow keys to move the cursor.
         h for left ;l for right
         j for down ;k for up
##To navigate the text in terms of words, you can use keys w, b, and e (also   
## W, B, E in real Vim).
         w moves to the START of the NEXT word;
         e moves to the END of the word;
         b moves to the START of the word.
##Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine
##movement keys with a number. 
	For example, 3w is the same as pressing w three  times
##Youcan insert text multiple times.
##For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30 -s.
	------------------------------
	with command "30i- Esc"

##Tofind and move to the next (or previous) occurrence of a character, use f and F(pre), 
#e.g. fo finds next o
##You can combine f with a number. For example, you can find 3rd occurrence of 'q' with 3fq

##In text that is structured with parentheses or brackets, ( or { or [
## use % to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket

#To reach the beginning of a line, press 0.
##For the end of a line, there's $ 

##Find the next occurrence of the word under cursor with *, 
##and the previous with #

##gg takes you to the beginning of the file; G to the end
##To jump directly to a specific line, give its line number along with g
	e.g.  3gg/3G goes to the beginning of line 3;

#Searching text is a vital part of any text editor. In Vim, you press /,
# and give the text you iare looking for
# You can repeat the search for next and previous occurrences with n and N, respectively

## To insert text into a new line, press o or O
#After new line is created, the editor is set to insert mode.

##x and X delete the character under the cursor and to the left of the cursor, respectively.

##When you need to replace only one character under your cursor, without changing to insert mode, use r

##d is the delete command;
#You can combine it with movement, e.g. dw deletes the first word on the right side of the cursor
#It also copies the content, so that you can paste it with p to another location

##To repeat the previous command, just press .

##Besides insert and normal mode, Vim has also visual mode
#Let's see how. 
	e.g.Goto visual mode with v. Then select a word with e. After you've selected the text, you can delete it with d

##Also don't PANIC! If you make a mistake, press u for undo and ctrl+R for redo
